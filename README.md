## What is this?
This is a challenge from HENNGE with some of their [description](#description) and [rules](#rules). I've solved their challenge as you can see in [here](https://github.com/drunktective/sos-go/blob/master/sos.go).

> ## Description
> - We want you to calculate the sum of squares of given integers, excluding any negatives.
> - The first line of the input will be an integer ```N (1 <= N <= 100)```, indicating the number of test cases to follow.
> - Each of the test cases will consist of a line with an integer ```X (0 < X <= 100)```, followed by another line consisting of X number of space-separated integers ```Yn (-100 <= Yn <= 100)```.
> - For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers, excluding any negatives, and print the calculated sum in the output.
> - **Note**: There should be no output until all the input has been received.
> - **Note 2**: Do not put blank lines between test cases solutions.
> - **Note 3**: Take input from standard input, and output to standard output.
> ## Rules
> - Write your solution using Go Programming Language
> - Your source code must be a single file (package main)
> - Do not use any for statement
> - You may only use standard library packages

## Sending the file to them with TOTP
With ```otp.py``` file, that will generate the 10-digit TOTP as an authorization with conforming to RFC6238 TOTP. Also thanks to [this one](https://github.com/yodalee/HDEchallenge/blob/master/mission3.py).
